# NODEJS

open-source and cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment. It is a popular tool for almost any kind of project!
Node.js runs the V8 JavaScript engine, the core of Google Chrome, outside of the browser
runs in a single process
provides a set of asynchronous I/O primitives
performs an I/O operation, like reading from the network, accessing a database or the filesystem, instead of blocking the thread and wasting CPU cycles waiting, Node.js will resume the operations when the response comes back.
When modules created by other developers are used in our code, they're called dependencies.

# NPM = command line tool to install, create, and share packages of JavaScript code written for Node.js

popular Node.js package is nodemon, a tool used to automatically restart a program when a file changes, alleviating the need to do so manually each time you save a file

# Express is nodejs web framework that will allow you to start and configure a server with very little overhead so you can focus on the important work of defining server behavior.

# Middleware is software that sits between the operating system and the applications on a network, providing common services and capabilities to applications outside of what's offered by the operating system. In web development, middleware refers to functions or methods that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle.

In the Context of Express.js
In an Express application, middleware functions are functions that can:

Execute any code.
Make changes to the request and response objects.
End the request-response cycle.
Call the next middleware function in the stack.
If the current middleware function does not end the request-response cycle, it must call next() to pass control to the next middleware function. Otherwise, the request will be left hanging.

Types of Middleware
Application-level Middleware: Bound to an instance of the express object and used throughout the app.

javascript
Copy code
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.use((req, res, next) => {
console.log('Time:', Date.now());
next();
});

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
res.send('Hello World!');
});

app.listen(3000);
Router-level Middleware: Bound to an instance of express.Router(), useful for modularizing the application.

javascript
Copy code
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();

router.use((req, res, next) => {
console.log('Request URL:', req.originalUrl);
next();
});

router.get('/', (req, res) => {
res.send('Home Page');
});

const app = express();
app.use('/home', router);
app.listen(3000);
Error-handling Middleware: Defined with four arguments instead of three. These middleware functions handle errors in the application.

javascript
Copy code
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
console.error(err.stack);
res.status(500).send('Something broke!');
});
Built-in Middleware: Provided by Express to handle common tasks.

javascript
Copy code
app.use(express.json()); // Parses incoming requests with JSON payloads
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true })); // Parses incoming requests with URL-encoded payloads
Third-party Middleware: Installed via npm and used to perform tasks such as logging, authentication, etc.

javascript
Copy code
const morgan = require('morgan');
app.use(morgan('combined')); // Logs HTTP requests
Real-life Example
Imagine you are building an e-commerce website:

Logging Middleware: Logs the details of every request for monitoring and debugging.
Authentication Middleware: Checks if the user is logged in before accessing certain routes.
Error-handling Middleware: Catches errors and sends a user-friendly error message to the client.

# What is an ORM?

An ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) is a technique that allows developers to interact with a database using an object-oriented paradigm. ORMs provide a way to map database tables to classes, rows to objects, and columns to object attributes, simplifying database operations.

# Sequelize

Sequelize is a popular ORM for Node.js that supports various SQL-based databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and MSSQL. It provides an easy-to-use API for defining models, performing CRUD operations, and running queries.
